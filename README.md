Trying to get Blender to read in the data from Unreal Engine COPY files


Long story short, this repository is for anyone who wants to try and help me get blender to correctly read COPY files and T3D files - then convert those settings into blender nodes.

It somewhat works as it is - just needs tweaking and fixing.

Long term goal:
Export LEVEL from Unreal Engine with all the materials/assets.
Add button to blender for "Load Unreal Engine Level"
Will load the level FBX + link all associated materials/create all objects.
